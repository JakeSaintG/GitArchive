# Git Archive

## The issue:
I have too many Git Repos (in my opinion). While I don't need almost 50 repos, I want to keep some of the ones where I learned something valuable or made a working application. It would also be great to keep some of the projects that I made when I was first starting development as a reference for future devs that I mentor.

## The solution:
Delete a few of the individual repos from my Github and consolidate into a single archive repo. This will allow me to store a few for reference and nostalgia.

## The consolidation:
I basically created this new repo, cloned a handful of existing repos into it, and added these existing repos as submodules to the new one.

These existing repos were copied exactly as they were and very little was done to change them. Their source remote repos were also likely deleted to free-up some of the clutter from my Github. These projects may have broken remote origins.
